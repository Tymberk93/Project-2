<b> The DataFrame contains a "category_id" column that has entries going sequentially from "cat1" to "catn", where n is the number of unique categories </b>

<b> The DataFrame has a "category" column that contains only the category titles </b>

<b> The category DataFrame is exported as category.csv </b>

<b> The DataFrame contains a "subcategory_id" column that has entries going sequentially from "subcat1" to "subcatn", where n is the number of unique subcategories </b>

<b> The DataFrame contains a "subcategory" column that contains only the subcategory titles </b>

<b> The subcategory DataFrame is exported as category.csv </b>

<b> The DataFrame has the following columns: </b>

* A "cf_id" column

* An "end_date" with the time formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD"

* A "category_id" column that contains the unique identification numbers matching those in the "category_id" column of the category DataFrame

* A "subcategory_id" column that contains the unique identification numbers matching those in the "subcategory_id" column of the subcategory DataFrame

<b> The campaign DataFrame is exported as campaign.csv </b>

<b> The DataFrame has the following columns: </b>

* A "contact_id" column

* A "first_name" column

* A "last_name" column

* An "email" column

<b> The contacts DataFrame is exported as contacts.csv </b>

<b> A database schema labeled, crowdfunding_db_schema.sql is created </b>

<b> A crowdfunding_db is created using the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file </b>

<b> The database has the appropriate primary and foreign keys and relationships </b>

<b> Each CSV file is imported into the appropriate table without errors </b>

<b> The data from each table is displayed using a SELECT * statement </b>
